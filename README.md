# Machine-Learning-Course

My slides and codes in the ML summer course at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad.

Most of the materials are taken from [CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io/) and  [introduction to scientific programming](http://btabibian.com/notebooks/learnpython/) and [Theano Tutorial](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/).

## Course Syllabus

 - `session 1:` Introduction to scientific computing with Python and Numpy.
 - `session 2:` Introduction to scientific computing with Matplotlib and Scipy.
 - `session 3:` Image Classification
 - `session 4:` Linear Classification
 - `session 5:` Optimization
 - `session 6:` Back Propagation
 - `session 7:` Neural Networks 1
 - `session 8:` Neural Networks 2
 - `session 9:` Neural Networks 3
 - `session 10:` Convolutional Neural Networks (+ a Theano tutorial script)

 
 
 
 ## Structure
 
 The python script corresponding to each session is provided in the session folder. For session 1 there are no slides, instead, there are several exercises which are solved in the python script.
